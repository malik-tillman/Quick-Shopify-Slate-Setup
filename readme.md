Quick Shopify Slate Setup
======
Use this to get started on developing a Shopify theme quick and easy. [Even though slate has been place on end of support](https://github.com/Shopify/slate#-slate---end-of-support-january-2020), it's my go to for developing Shopify themes. To get started, clone this repo and run the commands at the bottom. You can then either `migrate` an existing theme or generate a new `theme`. Use `slate -h` if anything.
